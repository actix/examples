# Websocket chat example

This is extension of the
[actix chat example](https://github.com/actix/actix/tree/master/examples/chat)

Added features:

* Browser WebSocket client
* Chat server runs in separate thread
* Tcp listener runs in separate thread

## Server

Chat server listens for incoming tcp connections. Server can access several types of message:

* `/list` - list all available rooms
* `/join name` - join room, if room does not exist, create new one
* `/name name` - set session name
* `some message` - just string, send message to all peers in same room
* client has to send heartbeat `Ping` messages, if server does not receive a heartbeat message for 10 seconds connection gets dropped

To start server use command: `cargo run --bin websocket-chat-server`

## Client

Client connects to server. Reads input from stdin and sends to server.

To run client use command: `cargo run --bin websocket-chat-client`

## WebSocket Browser Client
