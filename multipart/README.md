# Actix Web File Upload with Async/Await

### Requirements

``` Ensure rustup is installed. ```

``` Ensure make is installed. ```

### Run

``` make```

``` open web browser to localhost:3000 and upload file(s) ```

### Result

``` file(s) will show up in ./tmp ```

Note: this is a naive implementation and will panic on any error
