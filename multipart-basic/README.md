# multipart basic
Upload a file in multipart form. Save uploads and return filenames together with text data.
Files will be stored in /files by default. 

# note
Mostly copy paste from multipart+s3 (https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/multipart-s3) example just without the AWS and custom formData part.
