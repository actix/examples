# middleware examples

This example showcases a bunch of different uses of middlewares. See also the [Middleware guide](https://actix.rs/docs/middleware/)..

## Usage

```bash
cd middleware
cargo run
# Started http server: 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Look in `src/main.rs` and comment the different middlewares in/out to see how
they function.

## Middlewares

### redirect::CheckLogin

A middleware implementing a request guard which sketches a rough approximation of what a login could look like.

### read_body::Logging

A middleware demonstrating how to read out the incoming request body.

### simple::SayHi

A minimal middleware demonstrating the sequence of operations in an actix middleware.
There is a second version of the same middleware using `wrap_fn` which shows how easily a middleware can be implemented in actix.
