##### What?

We are going to create a web-server in `rust` that only deals with user registration and authentication. I will be explaining the steps in each file as we go. The complete project code is here [repo](https://gitlab.com/mygnu/rust-auth-server/tree). Please take all this with a pinch of salt as I'm a still a noob to rust 😉.

##### Flow of the event would look like this:

- Registers with email address ➡ Receive an 📨 with a link to verify
- Follow the link ➡ register with same email and a password
- Login with email and password ➡ Get verified and receive jwt token
