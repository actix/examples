# Actix Web File Upload with Async/Await

### Run

```sh
cd forms/multipart
cargo run
```

`open web browser to localhost:8080 and upload file(s)`

### Result

`file(s) will show up in ./tmp in the same directory as the running process`

Note: this is a naive implementation and will panic on any error
