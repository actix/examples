# cookie-auth

Testing with cookie auth with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se).

Login:

        curl -v -b "auth-example=user1" -X POST  http://localhost:8080/login
        < HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        < set-cookie: auth-example=GRm2Vku0UpFbJ3CNTKbndzIYHVGi8wc8eoXm/Axtf2BO; HttpOnly; Path=/
        < location: /

Uses a POST request with a Useridentity `user1`. A cookie is set and a redirect to home `/` follows.

Get:

Now with the cookie `auth-example` sent in a GET request, the `user1` is recognized.

        curl -v -b "auth-example=GRm2Vku0UpFbJ3CNTKbndzIYHVGi8wc8eoXm/Axtf2BO" http://localhost:8080/
